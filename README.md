# UCED_CCGT_CCS-Model
This is a unit commitment and economic dispatch model of a CCGT plant with a CCS unit.
The model was formulated in AIMMS, which can be downloaded here (https://www.aimms.com/support/downloads/) and is free for academic use, including the IBM CPLEX solver used to solve the numerical model.
The model was used to support the analysis of the research paper entitled "Economic modelling of flexible carbon capture and storage in a decarbonised electricity system" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032123007220?dgcid=author).
